		<Title>Create FIM-Table for Red Hat-v3</Title>
		<Description>Version 3: This task creates a logfile, FIMredhat_data.txt (for RedHat) which contains the status of a 'file-integrity-monitoring'-type assessment of particular parts of the filesystem. It can run initially, or to update the existing table. $Id: Create FIM-Table for Red Hat-v3.bes 99 2014-06-02 19:13:58Z singerj $</Description>
