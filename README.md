These are some fixlets/docs I created to create a 'poor mans File Integrity Monitoring' solution.

Note that this is by no means a complete File Integrity Monitoring product, and is not supported 
by me in any way, shape, or form.... If you use this, you're 'on your own'.

All it does is keep a checksum of selected files/registry entries and send a webreport-analysis
when something changes. It is up to the operator who receives the report to investigate, reconcile,
and remediate the problem.

This was originally done for a clothing retailer, and was based purely on their requirements, so it
has very limited functionality.

all best,
