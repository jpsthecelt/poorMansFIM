These are some fixlets/docs I created to create a 'poor mans File Integrity Monitoring' solution.

(Note that this is by no means a complete File Integrity Monitoring product, and is not supported 
by me in any way, shape, or form.... If you use this, you're 'on your own'.)

All it does is keep a checksum of selected files/registry entries and send a webreport-analysis
when something changes. It is up to the operator who receives the report to investigate, reconcile,
and remediate the problem. For a little more detailed explanation, see the accompanying wiki.

It was originally done as a project for a clothing retailer, based purely on their interim requirements, so it
has very limited functionality. The intent was to show what could be done in this environment.

all best,
